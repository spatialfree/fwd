[high level overview]
provides a structured work environment (with well paced/scoped time/effort mediation)
a platform for verbally articulating your experience (thoughts and emotions)
a better understanding of the passage of time (how long different things take)
breaks up task perseverance (blinders due to limited ram) *spinning wheels
an opportunity to appreciate what went well and what didn't

[low level overview]
records your screen for x minutes and then you get a break for 10m
repeats that process x times
it then compiles and speeds up the recordings
that you then you sit back and watch (listen to the music)
before verbally articulating your experience for as long as you can/need
